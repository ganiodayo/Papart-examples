## PapARt demo of Laval Virtual 2016

## Features

This demo has three distinct spaces:

* A lego house that is 3D mapped. You may need to build it yourself using LEGO Architecture. 
* An interactive garden. Green objets generate grass, and a high blue object (4 duplo in height) make a fountain. 
* A remote to control the modes in the house and reset the grass.
