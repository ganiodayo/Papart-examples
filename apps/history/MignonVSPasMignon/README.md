# Mignon VS Pas Mignon

This game was the first application to test the first touch tracking system.
While we updated the code to work with the different tracking systems, it is not
considered as good code nor as a good use of the framework.

## Description

During this game, creatures will appear on the screen. The goal is to caress the cute ones and hit the ugly ones.
If you enable sound, you will hear that cute creatures are making cute noises and ugly ones are screaming.
