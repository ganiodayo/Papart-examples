# Interface inside the AR


### The ARDisplay


### The GUI

In this example, we use a fork of [ControlP5](https://github.com/sojamo/controlp5) called [Skatolo](https://github.com/poqudrof/Skatolo). This example is specific to Skatolo, it is made for "touch surfaces" and also works with a mouse as shown here.
