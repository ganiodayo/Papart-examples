# SeeThroughOnePaper
 
This application shows how to use a camera to track markers on a surface and render objects in your computer screen.
 
##First file: SeeThroughOnePaper
The `settings()` method indicates how to render your processing app. Here we ask for a fullscreen application :  `fullScreen(P3D);`.
 
The `setup()` method contains the important variable `Papart papart`, loads the other files in the solution ([MyApp2D](https://github.com/potioc/Papart-examples/edit/master/papart-examples/Camera/SeeThroughOnePaper/PaperApp2D.pde)) and starts to track markers.
 
##Second file: MyApp2D
Markers are loaded in the `settings()` method, from a SVG file using this command `loadMarkerBoard(Papart.markerFolder + "A4-default.svg", 297, 210);`.

Objects can be added to the PaperScreen in the `drawOnPaper()` method, such as `rect(10, 20, 100, 75);` instructions.
 
# Example
 
Below are the markers you can put on any planar surface, as long as your camera can track them.

In the computer screen, several objects (blue and green rectangles) are rendered in the PaperScreen application. The image is from the camera point of view.
