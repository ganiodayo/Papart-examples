# Set the location of a 3D object from its viewed corners and size and known size.

In this example we want to save a 3D position of a planar object. The position is manually set by user.

### Todo:

* Add a `save as` button. 
* Better text input -> bug `4` was not working. 
* refactor of code. 

## Inputs
First the user enters the real size of the object in the corresponding inputs in the top left hand corner (see bellow). He has to press **change mode** button to make the changes effective.

Once those parameters are set, the user can arrange the shape of the 3D position he wants to record.
The 1st corner is selected, and he can drag it on the corner of the real image. Then he can press the 2 key and grab the second corner and set it where he wants, and so on.

## Buttons
###Orientation
Anytime the user can arrange the axis thus the orientation of the 3D position, by clicking on the corresponding buttons.

For exemple, we can see bellow that the user wanted to have the Y-Axis going towards the top of the image, so he pressed the **change Y axis** button.

###Saving
When the orientation and the position of the shape is correct, the user can press the **save** button and the position is saved in the marker.xml file, contained in the solution folder.

###Resizing
If he wants to change the object saved, the user can press **change mode** button and enter new sizes.
