#ExtractPlanarObjectForTracking
##Application
This application extracts images defined by user and save them. For example here we want to extract a book cover.

The interface is a simplified version of [GuiCorners](https://github.com/potioc/Papart-examples/tree/master/papart-examples/Camera/GuiCorners).

**/!\ Care about the orientation of your image, usually the zero has to be placed in the bottom left hand corner of your image!**

Press 1, 2, 3 or 4 and drag the selected corner to define an image to be saved.

Below is a picture of what the application looks like.

![ExtractPlanarObject](https://github.com/potioc/Papart-examples/blob/master/papart-examples/Camera/ExtractPlanarObjectForTracking/extractplanarobject.png)

When the square is correctly formed, the user can press the save button and the image contained in the square is saved.

##Result
Image saved in the folder: ExtractedView.bmp
