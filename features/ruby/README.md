### PapARt with JRuby Art

The usual Processing sketches are in fact Java applications. It is possible to use Processing 
with other languages such as [Python](http://py.processing.org/) and [Ruby](http://ruby-processing.github.io/). 

This is an example of an application created with Ruby instead of Java. 

## Installation 

Follow the installation steps from [JRubyArt](https://github.com/ruby-processing/JRubyArt). 
You do not need to install another version of Processing, nor any other libraries. 

## Running 

Go in this folder, and type: 

``` k9 run camProjKinectExample.rb ```
