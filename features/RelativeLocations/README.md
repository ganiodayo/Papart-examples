#Relative Locations
##Application

This example shows how to have several paperscreen linked together with objects between them.

We can get the position of each object and draw objects from those points.

`PVector v1 = obj1.getScreenPos();`

`PVector v2 = obj2.getScreenPos();`

`line(v1.x, v1.y, v2.x, v2.y);`
