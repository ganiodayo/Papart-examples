# Papart library examples.

Here are the Papart examples, to show atomic features.
Papart stands for PAPer Augmented Reality Toolkit. The core library is 
available on this [repository](https://github.com/poqudrof/papart).

## Goal of these examples. 

These examples are Processing sketches (PDE files), they demonstrate uses of the PapARt framework. If you want to use it without coding with the Processing IDE, you can load them from emacs, atom, and many other text editors with the right configuration. You can also do standard Java programs following this [example](https://github.com/Rea-lity-Tech/papart-app-example).

### What is new ?

- The community and commercial support are now availble on the [forum](http://forum.rea.lity.tech). 
- The examples now have two versions, one for “classical” AR and one for Spatial Augmented Reality (with projectors). They share most of the examples, we removed the SAR examples from master. You can still check them out in the [branch 1.2](https://github.com/poqudrof/Papart-examples/tree/1.2/). 

The [quick start guide](http://forum.rea.lity.tech/t/quick-start-with-a-webcam/18) is nearly ready. [Tutorials](http://forum.rea.lity.tech/c/papart-tutorials) are also in progress.
